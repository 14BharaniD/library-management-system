# 📚 Full-Stack Library Management System

A complete full-stack web application built from scratch using **Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, and **Thymeleaf**. This system provides a simple, clean, and responsive user interface for a librarian to manage a book inventory.

This project demonstrates a 3-tier architecture (View-Controller-Repository) and follows modern Java development practices.
